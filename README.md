# Cerci: AI-Powered Linux Systems Assistant

## Overview
Cerci is an intelligent systems assistant designed to streamline and enhance the user experience on Linux systems. By leveraging AI, Cerci translates user requests into actionable terminal commands and executes them seamlessly. The assistant communicates with an AI server via the Groq API using `curl` and handles command execution through system calls in Linux.

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Command Generation:** Cerci uses AI to interpret user requests and generate the appropriate bash commands.
- **Seamless API Integration:** Communicates with an AI server using HTTP requests via `curl`.
- **Efficient Command Execution:** Executes terminal commands using system calls in Linux.
- **User-Friendly:** Simplifies complex tasks by abstracting command syntax and operations.

## How It Works
1. **User Input:** The user provides a natural language request specifying the task they want to perform in the terminal.
2. **AI Query:** Cerci sends the user request to the AI server via the Groq API using `curl`.
3. **Response Handling:** Cerci receives the AI-generated bash command.
4. **Command Execution:** The command is executed directly using Linux system calls.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Linux operating system
- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- `curl` installed

### Build Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ayushman2004/cerci.git
   cd cerci
   ```

2. Compile the source code:
   ```bash
   g++ -o cerci cerci.cpp -lcurl
   ```

3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./cerci <request>
   ```

## Usage
1. Set up Groq API ans API_key
2. Cerci launch and request:
   ```bash
   ./cerci create a new directory called projects
   ```
3. Cerci will generate and execute the corresponding bash command:
   ```bash
   mkdir projects
   ```

## Example Scenarios
- **File Management:**
  ```
  ./cerci Delete all files with the .log extension in the current directory
  ```
  Cerci executes:
  ```bash
  rm *.log
  ```

- **System Monitoring:**
  ```
  ./cerci show me the current CPU usage
  ```
  Cerci executes:
  ```bash
  top
  ```

## Security Considerations
- Be cautious when executing commands generated by Cerci, especially commands that modify or delete files.
- Ensure the AI server and Groq API endpoints are secure.

## Future Enhancements
- Enhanced natural language processing capabilities.
- Improved error handling and logging.
